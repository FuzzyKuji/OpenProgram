"""Reading and writing the user's ``config.json``.

Every layer that reads or changes the user config goes through these four
functions; the file lives at ``openprogram.state.paths.get_config_path()``
(profile-aware). Writes are private (0o600), atomic and file-locked.

- ``read_config()``: the whole file as a dict, ``{}`` when it is missing.
  For read-only use. A file that is not valid JSON is unknown, not empty:
  it is set aside and its last good copy (``config.json.bak``) is read
  instead (``openprogram.state.last_good``).
- ``read_config_with_revision()``: a snapshot plus its exact-byte revision,
  for a later ``write_config`` / ``update_config`` that must refuse to
  clobber a concurrent change.
- ``write_config(cfg, expected_revision=...)``: full replace.
- ``update_config(mutator, expected_revision=...)``: the only correct way
  to change *part* of the config.
