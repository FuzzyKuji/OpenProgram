"""ACP agent-side server: protocol methods mapped onto the turn dispatcher.

Method coverage (protocol version 1):

  client → agent   initialize, session/new, session/load, session/prompt,
                   session/cancel
  agent → client   session/update, session/request_permission

Three translations do the real work.

**Prompt in.** ACP content blocks become one text message. A ``resource``
block is the editor's selection or open file shipped inline; it is fenced
under its URI so the model sees the path and the excerpt as context rather
than as the user's words. ``resource_link`` becomes a bare path mention.

**Events out.** ``process_user_turn`` emits ``chat_response`` envelopes;
``_on_event`` turns each into a ``session/update`` notification. Text →
``agent_message_chunk``, thinking → ``agent_thought_chunk``, tool start →
``tool_call`` (in_progress), tool end → ``tool_call_update``
(completed/failed).

**Working directory.** The session's first ``session/prompt`` creates the
conversation bound to the client's ``cwd`` as its project, the way
``openprogram --print`` binds the directory it runs in
(``working_directory_project``), so tools start there. Binding registers the
folder as a project (shown again if it was hidden) and writes its identity
marker, ``<cwd>/.openprogram/project.json``; a thread opened and never
prompted leaves nothing behind. The home folder needs no binding; a folder
that cannot be opened as a project runs unbound, with a warning on stderr.

**Permissions.** OpenProgram's approval gate opens a durable
``kind="approval"`` wait and suspends the turn's execution. The wait's
``question.asked`` frame reaches the prompt's event sink (or, for a turn
resumed after an earlier answer, the event bus); either is forwarded as ACP
``session/request_permission`` and answered with the canonical execution wait
command, which resumes the execution. ``session/prompt`` stays open until
that execution ends, so the editor sees the whole turn, resumed rounds
included. A client that answers the request with an error, or not within ten
minutes (sooner when the wait expires sooner), declines it, and the turn goes on without the operation.
Questions other than approvals have no ACP form and are declined at once.
The prompt also reads the execution's open waits while it is suspended, so
a wait whose frame never reached it is handled the same way. A wait for
system access cannot be granted from an editor: the turn is cancelled and
the prompt answers with an error naming the access it needs. A turn that
stops where nothing here can move it on (paused by someone else, needing
reconciliation, or suspended with no open wait) ends the prompt with an
error rather than keeping it open.
Nothing about the gate itself changes, so authority checks, hard
constraints, permission rules and the ``allow_always`` rule-persistence path
all behave exactly as in the web UI.

**Ends.** A turn that fails (a provider error, say) answers
``session/prompt`` with a JSON-RPC error carrying the reason, not a stop
reason, whichever round failed: a resumed round's error is read from the
attempt that ran it. A cancelled turn ends with ``cancelled``.

An ACP connection is a local editor driven by the person at the keyboard,
so turns carry ``local_owner_authority()`` — owner tier, interactive. That
is what makes ``approval.request`` available at all; a non-interactive
authority would auto-deny every gated tool.
