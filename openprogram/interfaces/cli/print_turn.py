"""One ``--print`` turn run in this process, and what the run reports.

Without a worker, a ``--print`` turn is admitted and activated the way a
channel or ACP turn is: a durable execution of the conversation turn path
(``process_user_turn`` under the production driver). It runs until the model
answers in text, with the same tool loop, compaction and loop guards as a
turn typed in the Web UI; nothing caps it at the handful of tool rounds a
library ``runtime.exec`` call gets.

The run works in the directory the command was started in: a new
conversation is bound to that directory as its project, so tools start
there, as they do in a Web conversation opened on a folder. No one is behind
the turn to answer an approval card or a question, so its authority says so
(``interaction="non-interactive"``): an operation that would ask is refused
at once and the question tool is not offered, rather than the run waiting
for an answer that never comes.

``--model provider/id``, ``--effort LEVEL`` and ``--permission-mode MODE``
are this turn's own: none is saved on the conversation, and a model the
provider lists runs without being enabled. ``--no-project-binding`` keeps a
new conversation out of the working directory. ``--usage-file``
receives a JSON summary of the run read from the usage ledger, where every
model request of the conversation is recorded with its tokens and cost.
``--transcript-file`` receives the turn as stored, one JSON record per line:
every model request with its tokens, and the model's text, reasoning, tool
calls with their full arguments and tool results, in order.
