"""One ``--print`` turn through the running worker.

The worker owns everything a turn may need that this short-lived process
does not have: the desktop App's built-in browser, the channel bridges, the
permission store, the memory writer and the sessions the Web UI shows. A
one-shot turn that ran here, in its own runtime, could not reach any of
them; the agent in a resumed Web session saw no browser at all.

So a one-shot turn is sent to the worker over its WebSocket, with the same
``chat`` command the Web UI sends, and this process only relays frames: it
collects the reply (or the structured output), answers the agent's
follow-up questions from the terminal, and stops the execution on Ctrl-C
or SIGTERM. The turn lands in the session store the way a Web turn does,
so the Web UI shows it live and on reload.

A stop is the Web UI's stop: the same ``execution.command`` cancel, which
names the execution whatever version it is at, and the relay waits, for a
bounded time, until
the worker says the execution has ended. The command then says whether
the turn stopped or may still be running.

The turn outlives the socket. A worker restart (a refresh, a promote)
closes every connection while the execution checkpoints and resumes on
the worker that comes back; once the ack has named the execution, the
relay reconnects, reads where the execution stands and follows the same
session and message id to the end, reading the reply from the session
when the turn finished while no socket was open.

:func:`resolve_worker` says whether a worker is there to take the turn;
without one the caller runs the turn in-process as before.

    Frames of other sessions share the socket (the worker broadcasts every
    ``chat_response``) and are skipped. ``on_text`` receives the streamed
    text deltas as they arrive; ``ask`` answers a ``follow_up_question``
    frame, ``None`` meaning no answer.

    A worker restart (a refresh, a promote) closes the socket while the
    execution goes on, or resumes, on the worker that comes back. Once the
    ack has named the execution, the relay reconnects (``reconnect`` finds
    the worker again, :func:`resolve_worker` by default), reads where the
    execution stands and follows it to its end; a turn that finished in the
    meantime has its reply read from the session.

    Raises :class:`WorkerTurnError` for an error frame, an ``action_error``
    or ``operation_error`` that answers the send, a socket that closes
    before the ack, a worker that does not come back in time, or an
    execution that failed or was interrupted while no socket was open;
    :class:`WorkerTurnCancelled` when the execution was cancelled
    elsewhere; :class:`WorkerTurnStopped` (a ``KeyboardInterrupt``) on
    Ctrl-C or SIGTERM, once the relay has cancelled the execution and
    waited for the worker to end it, saying whether it did. ``on_stop`` is
    called when that stop begins and returns the event a further signal
    sets, which shortens the wait. ``on_execution`` receives the
    execution id once the ack names it, however the turn then ends;
    ``on_server`` who the Worker says it is, on connect and in the ack
    (``handshake.server_identity``); ``on_ack`` the ack's data, which names
    the permission mode the turn runs with. The command says who sent it
    (``client``), and the returned turn carries the Worker's version and
    capabilities.

    ``model`` (``provider/id``), ``effort`` and ``permission_mode`` apply to
    this turn only (``turn_model``, ``turn_effort``,
    ``turn_permission_mode``): nothing is saved on the conversation or its
    branch. ``project_id`` binds a conversation the turn starts, as the Web
    composer's folder does on a first message. ``branch_id`` runs the turn
    on that branch of the conversation.

    ``non_interactive`` tells the worker no one is behind the turn (no
    terminal to ask on), as the in-process turn's authority does: an
    operation that would ask for approval is refused at once and the
    question tool is not offered, so the turn never waits on a card no one
    will answer.
