"""Project file search + read endpoints — backs the composer's @file mention.

Two endpoints:

* ``GET /api/file-search?q=...&root=...&limit=...`` — BFS walk under
  ``root`` (defaults to the running worker's cwd) returning files whose
  basename or relpath matches the needle, case-insensitively. Mirrors
  the TUI's ``apps/cli/src/utils/fileCompletions.ts`` algorithm so both
  frontends present the same ranking. With ``session_id`` (and, for a
  chat not created yet, ``project_id``) instead of ``root`` it searches
  the chat's working directory, the folder its agent runs in.

* ``GET /api/file-read?path=...&root=...`` — read a single file as text.
  Used by the web composer to expand ``@path`` tokens into the outgoing
  message body, and by the chat's attachment viewer (which passes an
  ABSOLUTE ``path`` instead of a root-relative one). Limits payload size
  + blocks reads outside ``root`` so random users with a webui port open
  can't exfiltrate /etc/passwd.

* ``GET /api/file-page?path=...`` — an HTML file as a sandboxed page
  (scripts on, opaque origin) for the chat card's thumbnail.

* ``POST /api/file-reveal?path=...`` — select that absolute path in the
  worker machine's file manager (same root check as file-raw).

* ``GET /api/file-raw?path=...`` — the BYTES behind an absolute path, so
  the chat can render an attachment the user or the agent sent. The
  files panel's ``/files/raw`` deliberately refuses absolute paths (it
  is scoped to one project id); rather than weaken that invariant, this
  is a second route with its own contract — an absolute path checked
  against ``attachments.readable_roots()``.

All are read-only and scoped. An explicit ``root`` is only accepted when
it falls under an allowed root (the project root or a session workdir) —
see ``_resolve_root`` — so the containment check isn't defeated by simply
asking for ``root=/etc``.
