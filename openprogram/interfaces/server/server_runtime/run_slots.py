"""The run slots of every conversation branch, and the operations in them.

One table, ``server._run_slots``, keyed by ``(session_id, branch_key)``:
each branch of a conversation has at most one foreground operation at a
time. The selected branch's slot has ``branch_key == SELECTED`` while the
selection is one per conversation; every other recorded branch is keyed by
its ``branch_id``. ``server._running_tasks`` (session -> selected slot) and
``server._branch_running_tasks`` ((session, branch) -> slot) are views of
that table, so a reader of either sees the same entries.

A slot entry is the operation: ``op_id``, ``op_kind`` (``reply``,
``compact``, ``retry``, ``edit``, ``rewind``, ``branch``, ``function``),
``op_version`` (raised by a stop) and the turn's execution ids once it has
them. Branches never block each other. The one exception is an operation
whose ``op_scope`` is ``conversation``: a rewind that changes files on
disk. It is refused while any other branch runs or waits on an approval,
and while it runs no branch is admitted.

A request that carries a key (``op_key``) and finds its own key on the
slot is a repeat of the operation holding it, not a second operation. A
rewind, revert or reapply repeated with its idempotency key joins: it
waits for the holder to end, then goes through the store, which returns
the holder's recorded outcome. A send or function run repeated with its
``client_request_id`` is answered ``request_admitted``: one send admits
one execution. Anything else is refused as before.
