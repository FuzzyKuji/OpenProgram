"""The ``set_conversation_channel`` action.

Picking a channel account on a chat ties that chat to the account's
conversation both ways. The chat's own meta records the channel, account
and peer (the sidebar prefix, the chip, the per-peer ownership check), and a
session alias (``runtime/agent_registry/session_aliases``) makes inbound
routing deliver that peer's messages into this chat instead of the
session the binding's ``session_scope`` would pick. Every assistant reply
in the chat goes out through the same account: replies to those messages
from the channel's inbound path, every other turn's (typed in the App,
always-on, scheduled) from ``runtime/conversation/bound_reply``.

The peer is the one the client sent, or else the account's owner chat
(WeChat: the user who scanned the bot's QR code). A platform with no
owner chat and no peer from the client records the binding only.
