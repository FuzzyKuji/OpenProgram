"""The ``chat`` action: admission, reservation and turn execution.

:func:`handle_chat` runs the turn as a sequence of phases. Parsing lives in
``turn_request``, the ``/skill`` expansion in ``turn_skill``, local builtin
commands in ``turn_local_command`` and the running-task hand-off and run
thread in ``turn_launch``; this module keeps the session, reservation,
run-config and admission phases.
