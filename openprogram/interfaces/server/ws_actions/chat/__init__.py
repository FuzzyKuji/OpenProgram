"""Chat WS actions: chat / retry_function /
set_conversation_channel.

The ``chat`` action is the sole turn entry point from the web UI. The
retry / channel-bind actions are ws-only.

The implementation is split by responsibility into the modules of this
package. This module re-exports their names and the ``ACTIONS`` table so
existing imports keep working; patch a name in the module that reads it.
