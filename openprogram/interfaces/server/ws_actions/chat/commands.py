    Frontend sends ``{action: "compact", session_id, keep_recent_tokens?}``.
    We delegate to ``trigger_compaction``, which compacts the chain ending
    at the session's head through ``engine.compact`` (LLM summary, one
    summary node spliced in, compaction frames).

    Compaction rewrites the history the branch's next turn reads, so it is
    that branch's foreground operation (``op_kind: "compact"``): refused
    with ``run_active`` naming what runs while the branch is busy, and no
    turn starts on that branch until it ends. Other branches keep running.
    Every client shows it as the branch's run with a Stop, which names its
    ``op_id`` (``operation.cancel``). It runs as a background task so the
    requesting socket keeps serving its other actions during the summary
    call.
