"""Turns that arrive during a version switch wait here and run after it.

From step 3 of activation until step 11 no new turn starts. A message, a
scheduled turn or an always-on wake that reaches admission in that window is
saved under ``self-updates/held/`` with what is needed to resubmit it, and the
sender is told it will run. The worker of whichever version comes up runs them
when admission reopens, whether the switch succeeded or rolled back.

A saved turn is deleted only once it has run or its reply is already there. One
that fails stays claimed and the watchdog's next pass tries again; after
``MAX_ATTEMPTS`` it moves to ``held/failed/`` and the owner is told.
