"""Find the latest official release and bring it here over the network.

The order is what keeps a bad server harmless:

1. Ask which release is latest (``github_release.github``).
2. Read ``update-manifest.json``, its signature and ``SHA256SUMS``, and check
   them in memory. Nothing is written until they pass.
3. Download only the files this machine lacks for its platform into a staging
   directory, each held to the size in the signed manifest and the hash in the
   signed sums. A download that stops resumes on the next run.
4. Hand the directory to the update controller, which checks everything again.

A refusal removes what was downloaded and changes nothing else.
