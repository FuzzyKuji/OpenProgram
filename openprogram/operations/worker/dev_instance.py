"""Stable and development instances of one source checkout.

The stable instance is the installed App (``/Applications/OpenProgram.app``,
port 18100, ``~/.openprogram``) and only ever runs the ``stable`` branch.
The development instance is a runtime (port 18200,
``~/.openprogram-dev``) that runs whatever ``dev`` commit was deployed to
it last, opened in ``/Applications/OpenProgram Dev.app`` on macOS or in a
browser. Commits reach stable only by promotion: a commit that the
development instance is serving, healthy, is fast-forwarded onto
``stable`` and installed into the App by ``scripts/refresh-local-app.sh``.

Both build from managed detached worktrees of the source repository, so
neither depends on the state of a developer's checkout.
