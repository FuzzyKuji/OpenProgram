> Usage metering — records every LLM call's tokens / model / cost.

## Overview

Public API:

  usage_scope(call_kind=...)      label the source of LLM calls in a block
  record_message(model, message)  record one finished call (called at the
                                  stream.py chokepoint; rarely called directly)
  default_ledger.query(...)       aggregate recorded usage for panels/CLI
  register_usage_hook(fn)         subscribe to events (budget/alerting)
  prefix_fingerprint.expect_break announce a prompt-cache break made on purpose
