"""What usage metering needs from the Goal tool.

A chat Goal carries a token / cost budget, so the usage ledger checks the
Goal before a provider request starts and refreshes the Goal's usage after
one ends. Models sit below Programs and never import the Goal tool
(``openprogram.programs.tools.planning.goal``); this port owns the
vocabulary both sides share and the Goal tool fills in the behaviour when
it loads (``openprogram.programs._host.lower_layers``).

Owned here, so there is one definition of each:

* :class:`GoalConflictError`, :class:`GoalStateUnavailable` — the Goal's
  two refusals, raised by the ledger and the Goal tool alike;
* :data:`turn_goal` — the Goal identity bound to the running chat turn.

Registered by the Goal tool, with the answer of a process where no Goal
tool ever loaded as the default: :func:`locked` holds nothing,
:func:`load_goal` finds no Goal, :func:`publish`,
:func:`refresh_usage` and :func:`accumulate_goal_usage` do nothing.
