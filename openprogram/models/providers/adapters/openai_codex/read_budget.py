"""The time budgets a Codex reply is read under, whatever carries it.

One reply, read a piece at a time (an SSE line over HTTP, a frame over the
WebSocket), is bounded three ways, whichever trips first:

* no bytes at all for ``STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_S`` — a dead connection;
* no real data for ``STREAM_DATA_STALL_TIMEOUT_S`` — a stream that only
  sends keepalives (Codex pings during reasoning);
* the optional total ``STREAM_TOTAL_TIMEOUT_S`` and the caller's own
  deadline (``runtime.exec(timeout_s=…)``).

The caller's cancel signal (the Stop button) is polled at 4 Hz without
cancelling the read in flight: cancelling and restarting a network read on
every poll made a model pause longer than the poll look like the server
closing the stream.
