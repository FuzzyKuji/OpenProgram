"""Requests a provider refused for their shape, mended and sent again.

Some refusals say exactly what to change: the body is over the provider's
byte cap (:mod:`body_cap`), or the model takes no conversation ending with
the assistant (:mod:`prefill`). Each such repair is a module with two
hooks:

* ``before_sending(model, context) -> Context`` applies what was learned
  from earlier refusals, so the same refusal is not met again;
* ``after_refusal(model, context, refusal) -> Context | None`` answers
  the mended request when ``refusal`` is one it knows, else ``None``.

:func:`prepared` runs the first hook of every repair before a request
goes; :func:`repairing` reads a provider's events and, when an attempt is
refused before it said anything, asks the repairs in turn and sends the
first mended request again, at most :data:`MAX_RESENDS` times. Events are
never held back: the consumer sees the reply begin once (a resent
attempt's first ``start`` is dropped), and the refusal itself is never
passed on. Every provider stream goes through here
(``streaming.stream._metered``).
