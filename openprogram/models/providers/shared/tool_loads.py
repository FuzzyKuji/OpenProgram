"""Load records: how a deferred tool becomes available, as data in history.

Loading a deferred tool is written into the result of the call that loaded
it, as ``ToolResultMessage.details["loads"]``: one ``{"name", "definition"}``
per tool, the definition being the tool's ``{"name", "description",
"parameters"}`` at the moment it was loaded. A provider that loads a
searched tool from the search's own result (the Responses
``tool_search_output``) sends that definition as it was stored, so an
aged, truncated or re-rendered result text and a later schema change
leave the bytes already sent alone.

The record is a durable detail of a tool result (``durable_details``),
with the attachment sent after it and where its whole text is kept: the
tool node keeps them in its metadata, and rendering history puts them back
on the ``ToolResultMessage``.
