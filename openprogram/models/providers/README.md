# `openprogram/models/providers/`

> pi_ai — Unified LLM API

## Overview

Python mirror of @mariozechner/pi-ai.

Provider detection is :func:`detect_provider`. Building a Runtime is the
runtime layer's (``openprogram.runtime.agent.runtime.factory.create_runtime``,
with the provider-specific classes in
``openprogram.runtime.agent.provider_runtimes``); the provider packages
here hold only model, auth and wire code.
