"""Advisory file locking with the POSIX ``fcntl.flock`` surface on every platform.

The module exposes ``flock`` and ``LOCK_EX`` / ``LOCK_UN`` / ``LOCK_NB``. On
POSIX they are :mod:`fcntl` itself. Windows has no ``fcntl``, so single-byte
advisory locking is emulated with :func:`msvcrt.locking`, and the
``PermissionError`` it raises on contention becomes :class:`BlockingIOError`,
so call sites keep the POSIX exception pattern::

    from openprogram.host._platform import locking as fcntl

    fcntl.flock(fd, fcntl.LOCK_EX | fcntl.LOCK_NB)

Windows semantics:

* The lock is on byte 0 of the file; ``lseek`` to 0 runs before each call so
  a later ``seek``/``write`` on the same fd is unaffected (all callers either
  don't write or seek explicitly after acquiring).
* A blocking acquire (``LOCK_EX`` without ``LOCK_NB``) retries every 100 ms
  because ``msvcrt.LK_LOCK`` gives up after about 10 seconds.
* The lock is per process and per fd. Re-acquiring the same byte on the same
  fd is an error on Windows, matching POSIX exclusive semantics; no call site
  relies on re-entrant locking.
