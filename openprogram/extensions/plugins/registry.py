"""What each loaded plugin contributed, for the HTTP API and the commands registry.

The loader records a plugin's contributions here when it mounts them
(``_commands``, the skills directory) and clears them when the plugin is
disabled. The module holds data only; mounting goes through the plugin's
``ProgramContext``.
