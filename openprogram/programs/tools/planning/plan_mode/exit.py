"""exit_plan_mode — submit the drafted plan for user approval.

This tool is always wrapped by the dispatcher's approval gate
(``requires_approval=True``). The approval payload carries the
``plan`` argument so the UI shows the proposed plan to the user. If
the user approves, the tool body runs (clears the plan-mode flag and
returns a success message). If the user rejects, the gate returns a
refusal and the flag stays on — the LLM is expected to read
the rejection, revise, and either re-submit or change direction.

The plan is passed as the ``plan`` argument; OpenProgram has no
plan-file workflow.

_DESCRIPTION = """Send your finished plan to the user for a decision. This call is the approval request, so do not also ask for approval in your reply.

Put the whole plan in the `plan` argument, in markdown, written for the person reviewing it: which files change and how, new functions and where they live, the order of the work, edge cases, and anything they must weigh before agreeing.

If approved, plan mode ends and you carry out the plan. If rejected, plan mode stays on: change the plan to answer the reason given and send it again.

Settle open questions with the user before calling this. It is for proposed code changes; a task that only gathers information has nothing to submit.
