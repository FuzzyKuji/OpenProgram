    ``to="SID:HEAD"`` names a BRANCH (via any node on it), not a fork
    point — the branch may have run more turns since the sender saw its
    head, so delivering onto the given node verbatim would fork a new
    branch off history instead of continuing the conversation. Forking
    off a node is the agent tool's job (``agent(start_from="SID:MSG_ID")``).

    Snapping applies to LIVE branches only. A merged head names a
    branch a merge retired, and that branch keeps its own identity:
    resolving it onto the live branch that absorbed it would make
    archive_agent / read_conversation act on a different agent, so a
