"""How a message reaches an existing agent: always as a tracked Job.

Every ``send_message`` admits a Job on the target branch and returns its
``execution_id`` (this was ``agent(to=…)``'s path; the untracked message
form is gone, because tracking is what lets a Worker restart recover the
delivery and the reply). The target's final reply comes back to the sender
as a notice turn, which has no timeout, so a reply is never dropped while
the sender is busy: it waits in the sender's ``notices.json`` until the
sender is free (OpenCode pushes a child's result the same way).

A busy target never gets interrupted: the Job is admitted first, its inbox
entry travels on the Job (``Job.deferred_inbox``), and the target runs it
when its current turn ends.
