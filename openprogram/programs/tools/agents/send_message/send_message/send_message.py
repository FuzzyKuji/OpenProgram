"""send_message — the one way to reach an agent that already exists.

Deliver a message to an EXISTING agent → it runs one turn → its reply
comes back to the sender as a notice. ``to`` names the target:

  * ``"sid:head"``       — a branch. The node names the BRANCH, not a fork
                           point: delivery always lands on the branch's
                           current tip.
  * ``"<branch name>"``  — a named branch, or a helper by its description.
  * a conversation's id or exact title, or a saved Agent's name or id —
                           that conversation (the always-on handoff's
                           addressing, which this tool took over together
                           with ``agent(to=…)``).

Every message is a tracked Job (``dispatch.py``) with an
``execution_id``; a busy target queues it and is never interrupted. The
chain limits are ``depth.py``'s: 4 hops and 20 sends per conversation per
hour, no approval between agents.

Creating agents is the ``agent`` tool's job.
