"""``code``: Python that drives the targets, in the isolated GUI interpreter.

The interpreter is ``sandbox/runner.py``: a sandboxed child without
files, network or processes, stopped between calls. It reaches the host only
through ``sandbox/broker.py``, which records every primitive as an effect
of the running execution. Each call registers one broker resource per target
with the call's own approval scope (the declared app; the declared browser;
no upload from the built-in browser) and defines ``cu`` over those
resources, so ``await cu.app.click(...)`` is the action call of the same name.

One interpreter lives for one execution attempt of a conversation, so
variables carry across the code calls of a turn.
