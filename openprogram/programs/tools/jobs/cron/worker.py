"""Scheduler worker for one-time, recurring, and monitor tasks.

Reads the task file produced by the ``scheduler`` tool every minute. For
each due entry, spawns a
detached subprocess running the entry's ``prompt`` via
``process_user_turn``; a ``reminder`` entry fires in-process as one
``reminder.fired`` event (``openprogram/runtime/scheduler/reminders.py``).
Per-entry stdout/stderr lands in
``<schedule_dir>/logs/<entry_id>-<timestamp>.log``. Last-fired minute per
entry is persisted to ``<schedule_dir>/worker-state.json`` so a worker
restart within the same minute doesn't re-fire already-fired entries, and so
a recurring time that passed while the worker was down can be caught up once.

Usage:

    openprogram scheduler-worker            # run forever (foreground)
    openprogram scheduler-worker --once     # evaluate one tick and exit
    openprogram scheduler-worker --list     # show whether entries match now

Design notes:

- Foreground loop only. No double-forking, no service manager wrapping.
  Run it under tmux / nohup / launchd yourself if you want it to survive
  logout or reboot.
- Cron matching is hand-rolled (no ``croniter`` dependency). Supports
  the common Vixie syntax: ``*``, ``N``, ``N-M``, ``*/S``, ``N-M/S``,
  comma lists, and the ``@yearly/@monthly/@weekly/@daily/@hourly``
  macros. ``@reboot`` fires once when the worker starts.
- When day-of-month and day-of-week are both restricted (not ``*``),
  they combine with OR, matching Vixie/ISC cron semantics.
- The daemon logs an ordinary tick failure and waits for the next minute.
  ``--once`` remains fail-fast, and process-control ``BaseException`` values
  are never converted into daemon retries.
