"""Applications mount through the Programs loader, one ProgramContext each.

An application package is a directory with ``application.json``, its UI
and an optional Python backend. :func:`mount` is the single path for both
forms an application takes: a built-in one under
``programs/applications/<name>/`` (called by ``_registry`` beside its
``PROGRAM_ENTRIES`` and ``setup``) and an installed one recorded in
``catalog.json`` (called by :func:`load`). Through the application's
context it registers

- the served UI: the definition the asset route serves from the source
  directory, keyed by the content digest computed now;
- the ``application.<id>`` resource provider;
- one entry per operation marked ``agent: true``, named
  ``<id>__<operation>`` (see :func:`entry_name`), which runs the
  operation through the worker's application service — the same
  per-process runner and capability checks as the resource's ``act``.

An application directory placed directly in ``~/.openprogram/programs/``
is recorded on the next :func:`sync` (see
``catalog.adopt_user_applications``); one that needs trust waits for
``openprogram programs install <dir> --trust``.

``ctx.dispose()`` removes all three. Installed applications load in the
worker (:func:`sync` at start, after install/enable/disable, and when the
Programs watcher sees a source change); disabling one disposes its
context, and a changed source is disposed and loaded again with a fresh
digest.
