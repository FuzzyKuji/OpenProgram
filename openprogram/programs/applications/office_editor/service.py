"""The ``office_editor`` service: everything of the Office editor the server reaches.

The application's ``setup`` provides one :class:`OfficeEditorService` as the
service ``office_editor``. The server never imports the application; it
looks the service up (``openprogram.programs._host.services.lookup("office_editor")``)
and, when the lookup returns ``None``, answers that the Office editor is
turned off: the document window then offers only the original-file download.

Members:

- ``load()`` / ``pack``: the installed, verified Office pack, read once and
  kept; ``pack`` can be replaced (an installation does that).
- ``is_office_host(scope, port)`` / ``serve_asset(...)``: the isolated
  ``host-<session>.office.localhost`` origin and its manifest-bound files.
- ``availability(request)``: what ``GET /api/documents/office-host`` answers.
- ``install_rejection(request)``: why an installation request is refused,
  or ``None``.
- ``install()``: download, verify and select the pinned pack (blocking);
  ``INSTALL_ERRORS`` are the failures a caller reports as retryable.
- ``module_version`` / ``module_response(port)``: the parent module the
  document window imports from the main origin.
