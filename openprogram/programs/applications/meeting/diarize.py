"""Telling apart the speakers on the system-audio track.

Two tracks already separate the user ("me", the microphone) from everyone
else ("others", the computer's sound output). When a meeting stops, after
every chunk is transcribed, :func:`run` diarizes the whole system track
once with sherpa-onnx's offline speaker diarization (pyannote
segmentation-3.0 plus a 3D-Speaker ERes2Net embedding model, both ONNX)
and :func:`assign` gives each transcribed system-audio segment the
speaker whose turns overlap it most: ``others:1``, ``others:2``… numbered
in order of first appearance, shown as "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2"….

The number of speakers is not known, so clustering uses a distance
threshold rather than a fixed count. ``sherpa-onnx`` is an optional
dependency (the ``meetings`` extra) and is imported only here, only when a
meeting stops. The two models are downloaded into
``<state>/models/diarization/`` from sherpa-onnx's GitHub releases on
first use. Without the package or the models, :func:`run` raises
:class:`Unavailable` (``not_installed`` / ``no_model``) and the system
track stays "Others".
