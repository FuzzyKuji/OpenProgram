"""The built-in Agents: the saved Agents every instance starts with.

There are two kinds, each a general Agent with its specialisations, and
the always-on switch tells them apart:

- For chat, always-on off: Assistant, the default Agent (created by
  setup, not here), and three fixed-parameter configurations derived from
  it (Decision, Lightweight helper, Coordinator) with no prompt of their
  own; the task comes from the call and its Context.
- For work that goes on while the user is away, always-on on from the
  install: Butler, a general Agent whose conversations wake when
  something they watch is due, and otherwise later each time nothing
  happens, from their first message, and ten job Agents derived from it. A job
  Agent is a complete configuration for one kind of work: a system prompt
  that names the job, the deliverable, what it never does, when it is
  done and how it works; the tools the job needs and nothing more; a
  memory policy; and no fixed wake interval: each schedules its own
  wakes, and with none scheduled the next comes later each time nothing
  happens (a job Agent with research off runs no check-in at those wakes). An Agent with no conversation
  never wakes, so an installed job Agent costs nothing until the user
  starts a conversation with it. They work together through handoffs
  between their conversations.

The built-in ones are what the reference products call bot templates, and
here they are simply saved Agents: the server installs the ones that were
never installed when it starts (``create_builtin_agents``), and from then
on each is an ordinary record. Edit it, duplicate it, delete it; nothing
recreates it, because the registry index remembers which built-ins have
been installed on this instance. A copy nobody has changed follows the
definition when a new version changes it; a changed copy stays as it is.
