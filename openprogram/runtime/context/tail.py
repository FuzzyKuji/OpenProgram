"""The bounded tail a background turn reads of its conversation.

A background turn (an always-on check-in) looks at the conversation; it must
stay cheap however long the conversation has grown, and it must never compact
what belongs to the owner. So instead of shrinking the conversation it reads
less of it: the active summary, then only the latest steps that fit the
budget. What it did not read stays reachable through ``read_conversation``.

The cut falls between steps. A step is a top-level node (a user message, a
reply, a direct function call) or one call a reply made together with
everything under that call, so a tool call and its result are always kept or
dropped together. The reply that made a kept call is kept with it.

A step costs what the renderer sends for it, not what the node stores: a
spilled result reaches the model as head and tail, an old result as a stub,
and a ``/skill`` message as its whole body.
