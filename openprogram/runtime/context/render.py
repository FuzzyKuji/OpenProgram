"""DAG → provider messages rendering.

Given a Graph and a list of node ids (typically the output of
:func:`render_context`), turn them into a sequence of pi-ai ``Message``
objects the way providers expect.

This is the bridge that lets ``runtime.exec`` build its LLM prompt
straight from the DAG, replacing the legacy tree-Context
``render_messages`` path.

Mapping rules
-------------

    Call(role=user)     →  UserMessage(content)
    Call(role=llm)      →  AssistantMessage(content)
    Call(role=code)     →  pair: UserMessage(call signature) +
                                  AssistantMessage(result)
                          unless metadata.expose == "hidden"
                          (those should already be excluded upstream
                          by render_context / dispatcher, but the
                          renderer also defends against them.)

Visibility / hiding semantics live in :func:`render_context` — the
renderer is a strict translation pass on whatever ids it gets.

A finished turn renders the way its own requests sent it, so the
provider's cached prefix still matches when the next turn starts:

* a user message carries the blocks its turn put in front of it (the
  recalled memory, the run note), stored on its node;
* a reply goes back one provider response at a time, as the turn sent it:
  that response's reasoning, text and calls in one assistant message,
  then the results of those calls. Reasoning goes back, to the model that
  wrote it only, as the provider's own signed item (a Responses reasoning
  item with its encrypted content); text goes under the message id the
  provider gave it. The reply's
  ordered blocks mark where each response began (``round_start``); a reply recorded without the marks
  sends its calls one per message, each with its result, and its text last;
* the reply is the model's own (its provider, api and model), so the
  provider keeps the ids it issued.

    :func:`openprogram.state.store.session.spill.spill_if_large`) and carries the
    path in ``metadata.spilled``; the renderer only cites it.

    Args:
        graph:    the DAG to look up nodes in.
        read_ids: node ids to include, in chronological order (as
                  produced by :func:`render_context`).
        session_directory: the session's directory on disk, when the
                  caller knows it: kept media are read from its ``media/``
                  (``store.session.media``), else from the path each
                  record names. Spilling does not read it.
        reasoning_for: the model the messages are sent to. A reply this
                  model wrote goes back with its reasoning; any other
                  reply, and every reply when this is None (a summary
                  source, a token estimate), goes back without it.
                  Another model cannot use a reasoning item and would
                  read its summary as text the assistant said.
        audience: who the request is built for (``context.turn_context``):
                  a conversation turn's own request shows the section
                  notes stored beside earlier messages; any call with a
                  system prompt of its own (the default) does not.

    Returns:
        list of provider ``Message`` objects (``UserMessage`` /
        ``AssistantMessage``). Unknown ids and ``expose="hidden"``
        code Calls are silently skipped.
