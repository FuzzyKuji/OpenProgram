"""How long an unattended run may go on before it is stopped.

Nobody watches a check-in or a scheduled run, so a stuck one would otherwise
hold its place and keep spending for ever. The clock starts when the run is
admitted and is not reset by a restart, so a resumed run counts its earlier
time too. A stop goes through the execution control path with the reason
:data:`TIME_LIMIT`, and that reason is how each ending says why it stopped.

The Worker checks every run it can reach (:func:`stop_overdue`). A scheduled
run in its own process cannot be signalled from the Worker, so that process
keeps its own clock (:func:`watch`).

A stop is a request, and a turn stuck in a blocking call never acts on it. A
run still stopping :data:`STOP_GRACE_S` later is ended without it, and its
process killed if it has one of its own, so nothing goes on waiting for it.
