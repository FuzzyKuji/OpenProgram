"""How a run of a scheduled task comes to its end.

A run stops in one of three places: in its own process, in a new Worker that
picked up the turn after a restart, or in its own process after the Worker that
started it has gone. All three go through :func:`conclude` and :func:`finish`,
so they get the same record and the same rule for telling the user.

Only a terminal execution is an ending. A pause, an effect still being settled,
or a turn saved during a version switch goes on later, and only where it truly
ends does anything get recorded or sent. A run the user stopped records nothing:
they know, and it says nothing about whether the task works. A run stopped at
its time limit is a failure, since nobody asked for that. An empty reply counts
as nothing new.

The process that runs a turn keeps its ending on disk before telling the Worker
(:func:`keep`), and the Worker's scheduler picks up what no Worker heard
(:func:`finish_kept`). ``task_runs`` counts a turn once, by its execution id, so
one that arrives by two of these paths still tells the user once.

The user is told before the row is written, because the row is what marks a run
as done. A report that raises leaves the ending on disk with its failure count
and an attempt number; each tick tries again, up to ``ANNOUNCE_ATTEMPTS``, and
after the last only the row is saved.
