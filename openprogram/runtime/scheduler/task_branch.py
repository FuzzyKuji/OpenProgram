"""The branch a scheduled task works on.

A task that runs a prompt is an agent of its own inside its conversation.
The first run opens a branch off the conversation's head; the branch's
meta entry records the task (``scheduled_task_id``), and every later run
continues at that branch's tip, so a task never holds more than one branch.
The entry moves with the tip the way a branch name does.

Each run starts clean: the model gets the task and the last result that said
something, not the branch's whole history and not the main conversation. A
run with nothing new answers ``QUIET_MARK``; it stays on the branch and tells
nobody. A run that could not do its check answers ``UNABLE_MARK`` and the
reason, which counts as a failed run (``task_runs``).
