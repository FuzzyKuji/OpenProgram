"""What the permission package needs to know about the running conversation.

Permission decisions read a few facts that the conversation package owns:
which session and execution the current task is bound to, whether a turn
is running, the session's plan mode and stored rules, its project's
defaults, and the model it chats on. The permission package sits below
the conversation package and never imports it; instead the conversation
package registers a :class:`SessionFacts` implementation on import
(``openprogram.runtime.conversation.permission_registration``).

The defaults describe a process in which no conversation exists: nothing
is bound, no turn runs, no session holds rules. Each of those values can
only become something else through the conversation package, and
importing any part of it registers the real facts first.
