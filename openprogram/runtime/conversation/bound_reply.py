"""Deliver a bound chat's assistant replies to its channel conversation.

A chat bound to a channel account (its session names ``channel`` and
``account_id``: picked on the composer's channel chip, or a conversation
that arrived from the channel) gets every assistant reply in that channel,
whatever started the turn. The source of the turn decides who sends it:

* a turn that came in from the chat's own channel (``source`` is that
  channel) is answered by the channels' inbound dispatcher, so it is
  skipped here, and nothing is sent twice;
* a component turn of another execution (``agent_spawn``) is not a reply
  of this chat and is skipped;
* a background turn (an always-on check-in, a scheduled task's run) sends
  nothing here; what it has to say goes out once, as its report
  (``always_on.runtime``);
* a turn that receives a handoff message (📨) answers the conversation
  that sent it, so it is skipped; the reply that comes back (↩️) is sent;
* every other turn (typed in the App, a Goal turn, a reminder) is sent
  from here.

The recipient is the peer whose messages the chat receives: its routing
alias for the bound account, else the peer of a conversation that arrived
from the channel, else the account owner's chat (a WeChat bot's owner,
who scanned its QR code). A chat with no known peer (a Telegram, Discord
or Slack account picked without one) sends nothing rather than guess.

Only the reply text goes out, through the channels' own reply path
(``channel_link.open_reply``: paragraphs as they stream, text before a
tool call before the tool runs, files as attachments). A failed send is
logged and shown in the App as a ``channel_delivery_failed`` chat frame.
A response sent again after a transport failure drops its unsent text;
paragraphs already sent stay, and are not sent again when the new
response repeats them.

The end of a delivery (the rest of the reply, its files) runs on a
background lane per recipient, in order, so a slow platform never holds
the turn, its result in the App or the next turn of the chat. A turn
that pauses (an approval) sends everything it streamed before it stops;
the attempt that resumes it sends only what it streams itself, plus the
turn's files, so nothing before the pause goes out twice, however many
times the turn paused and whichever path sent the first part.
