"""Turn persistence — write the assistant message to SessionDB.

Extracted from dispatcher/__init__.py (dispatcher-split step 5, the
assistant-persistence piece). ``persist_assistant_message`` is phase 5 of
process_user_turn: resolve the model/provider columns, backfill usage via
Anthropic's count-tokens endpoint when the proxy dropped usage chunks,
build the assistant row (terminal status + token columns + ordered
blocks), strip Agent method calls out of the slim tool_calls list
(they render as their own runtime-block row), and persist — updating the
turn-start placeholder in place when one exists, else appending.

Returns ``(assistant_msg, blocks, tool_calls, usage)`` because phase 6
(finalize) and phase 7 (the TurnResult) consume the possibly-rewritten
usage + the filtered tool_calls + the ordered blocks. It touches none of
the test-patched helpers (only _is_anthropic_family / _mark_terminal_status,
neither of which any test patches), so it can live in its own module
without breaking the dispatcher tests' monkeypatch seam. The phase-2 user-
message persistence will join this module in a later step.

See docs/design/runtime/dispatcher-split.md.
