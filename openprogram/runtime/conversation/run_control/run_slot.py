"""The conversation run slot, as a port the hosting server fills.

The selected branch of a conversation runs one turn at a time. (A turn on
a recorded branch that is not selected takes that branch's own slot in the
server and runs beside it; nothing the runtime starts on its own does.)
The web server owns the selected branch's slot
(its run reservation, the running task it shows and the guard every chat
entry point takes), so a turn the runtime starts on its own, such as a
reminder wake or a handed-over message, must take the same slot or it runs
on top of the owner's turn. (An always-on check-in runs beside the
conversation on a side branch and takes no slot.) The runtime cannot import the server; the
server registers itself here instead. Without a host the slot falls back
to the in-process turn registry.
