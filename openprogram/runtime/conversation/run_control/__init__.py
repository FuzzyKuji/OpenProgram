"""
Run control for turn execution: cancel / session binding /
active-runtime registry.

Execution binding and cancellation (tokens, the current session and
execution, live owners, exact cancel, child admission) live in
``openprogram.runtime.execution.run_control`` and are imported from there.
This package holds the turn side: turn tokens and cancel events
(``turns``), active exec runtimes (``active_runtimes``), the pre-approved
wait binding (``session_binding``) and the worker-stop and cancel hooks.

This is turn-execution state, not a UI concern — the web UI, the job
runner, channels, process runners and long-running tools all steer the
same machine. Importing this module claims the core's host-integration
seams (``set_cancellation_check`` / ``set_session_id_provider``), which
is what makes the exec loop cancellable; the call core itself
never imports this layer and keeps its headless defaults when nobody
does.
