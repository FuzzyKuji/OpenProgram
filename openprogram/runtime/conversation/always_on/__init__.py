"""Always-on: an Agent configuration that makes its conversations wake.

Every conversation that uses an always-on Agent wakes on the Agent's
schedule or when it scheduled itself, works on the standing goal as an
ordinary chat Goal there, does silent read-only check-ins on a side branch
while it has no unfinished Goal, and reports with ``always_on_report``: a
message from the Agent in the conversation, a notification, and the
channel conversations chosen for the Agent or bound to the chat. Quiet hours and wake days hold scheduled wakes back,
and ``handoff`` gives work to another conversation of the owner.
