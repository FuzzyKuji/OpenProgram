"""Wake an always-on conversation: start its standing Goal or a background check-in.

Always-on is part of an Agent's configuration; the conversations that use
the Agent are what wake. Each keeps its own Goal, check-ins and reports.

A check-in runs beside the conversation, on a side branch of it, so the
owner sees nothing of it unless it reports; a report reaches the
conversation as an ordinary message from the Agent.
