"""The Agent engine's registrations with the execution control plane.

Imported by ``openprogram.runtime.conversation`` itself, so any process that
loads conversations can have its Agent executions activated, restarted and
cancelled by ``openprogram.runtime.execution``. Every hook imports the engine
lazily, when the control plane first calls it. Importing this module also
loads ``openprogram.runtime.jobs``, which registers the Job hooks: a
conversation spawns and cancels Jobs.

The conversation engine also registers the Goal hooks. A chat Goal runs as
conversation turns, and the Goal tool (``openprogram.programs.tools.planning
.goal``) loads on first use, which can be later than startup recovery; these
hooks import it when first called, so registration never depends on when the
tool loaded.
