"""Continue an interrupted chat as a new turn after a worker restart.

The control plane records a restart intent and decides eligibility
(``openprogram.runtime.execution.chat_recovery``); admitting and activating
the new turn needs the Agent engine, so this module is the
``recovery_turn_starter`` hook that ``execution.restart`` calls.
