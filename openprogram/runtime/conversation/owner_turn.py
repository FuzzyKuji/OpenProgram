"""Start an owner chat turn in a conversation without a client sending it.

Reminders that wake the agent and messages handed over from another
conversation need a turn the owner sees in the conversation, under that conversation's own permission settings, as if the
owner had typed ``text``. The turn runs on a daemon thread; ``on_done``
receives its result (``None`` when it never ran).
