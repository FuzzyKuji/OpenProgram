# Execution control

This package owns OpenProgram's canonical execution-control data model and
durable store. It defines stable identities, lifecycle transitions, idempotent
control commands, and the append-only event history from which materialized
execution records can be rebuilt.

The same store owns immutable revisions, fenced physical attempts,
content-addressed checkpoint manifests, and the external-effect ledger. A live
attempt must hold the current unexpired lease before it can publish a
checkpoint or register and dispatch an effect. Unresolved dispatched effects
block checkpoint publication until reconciliation records a terminal receipt.

Execution engines do not belong here. Chat, Agent, Workflow, Job, and tool
drivers retain their own activation code and implement the driver contract
defined by the unified execution-control design. They report safe points and
outcomes to this control plane instead of writing lifecycle state directly.
The process-local driver registry stores only exact attempt/generation bindings;
it is not a lifecycle authority and cannot replace durable execution state.

This package imports no engine. The persisted schemas it decodes live here:
the Agent checkpoint payload (`agent_checkpoint.py`), a Job's admission input
(`job_input.py`) and the durable-function suspension evidence
(`function_suspension.py`). So does execution binding and cancellation inside
one process (`run_control/`). Where the control plane must start or ask an
engine, it calls a hook from `hooks.py` that the engine registers when its
package is imported: `openprogram.runtime.conversation` registers
`agent_activator`, `recovery_turn_starter`, `permission_wait_reconciler`,
`live_owner_signals`, `terminal_settler` and `session_goals`;
`openprogram.runtime.jobs` registers `job_records`, `job_runner` and
`turn_request_fields`. A missing required hook raises `EngineNotRegistered`;
`job_runner`, `live_owner_signals` and `terminal_settler` are optional,
because without their package there is no runner, subprocess or chat turn to
reach.

The control plane does not import Programs either. A chat Goal is settled
after each terminal execution (`terminal_settler`), and restart reconciliation
takes the session's Goal owner lock and pauses an interrupted Workflow Goal
(`session_goals`). The Goal tool loads on first use, which can be after startup
recovery, so the conversation engine registers these hooks and imports
`openprogram.programs.tools.planning.goal` when one is first called.

Admission stores an immutable input snapshot with the queued execution. Every
canonical event creates one durable delivery item for each fixed projection
(`dag`, `job`, `workflow`, and `ui`) in the same SQLite transaction. Projection
workers claim, acknowledge, retry, and reclaim those items independently; a
projection failure never changes canonical execution state.

`RuntimeControlService` commits pause and cancel intent before notifying a live
driver. Missing or failing local delivery leaves the durable command applying
for recovery. A pause becomes applied only after the current attempt publishes
a declared safe-point checkpoint and relinquishes ownership; cancel atomically
supersedes lower-priority applying commands.

Attempt finalization checks the effect ledger. A dispatched or uncertain effect
moves the execution to `reconciliation_required` instead of claiming a terminal
outcome. Once every effect has a terminal receipt, an applying cancel resumes
its canonical finalization; otherwise the execution becomes paused for an
explicit continuation decision.

The normative design is
[`docs/reference/design/runtime/execution/control.html`](../../docs/reference/design/runtime/execution/control.html).

`restart.py` records bounded worker restart intents in canonical events and
continues eligible checkpoints through the existing control/resource commands.
