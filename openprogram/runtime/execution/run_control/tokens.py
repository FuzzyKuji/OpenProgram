# Turn cancellation tokens — one per turn, never per session.
#
# A turn opens a fresh CancelToken; the LLM call, tool execution and every
# sub-task check that one object. Stopping trips the token of the turn that
# is running now. When the turn ends the token is retired, so a stop that
# arrives late cannot reach into the next turn. Nothing has to be reset on
# cleanup — the next turn simply gets a different object.
#
# The public names below (mark_cancelled / is_cancelled / clear_cancel)
# keep their meaning for callers and the WS protocol; they now resolve to
# the session's current token instead of a sticky boolean.
