"""Engine hooks: how the control plane reaches the engines built on it.

The control plane never imports an engine. Where it must start or ask one
(activate an Agent attempt, admit a restart turn, reconcile permission waits,
settle a session's Goal, read Job records), the engine registers a callable
here when its package is imported: ``openprogram.runtime.conversation``
registers the Agent and Goal hooks and ``openprogram.runtime.jobs`` the Job
hooks. Programs never register here: the Goal tool loads on first use, later
than startup recovery, so the conversation engine that runs Goal turns
registers for it and imports it when the hook is first called.

A required hook that nobody registered means no such engine runs in this
process; looking it up raises :class:`EngineNotRegistered` instead of
skipping the work. An optional hook is one whose absence is itself the
answer: without the Jobs package loaded there is no live Job runner, without
a process runner there is no subprocess to signal, and without the
conversation engine there is no chat turn whose terminal outcome a Goal
accounts.
