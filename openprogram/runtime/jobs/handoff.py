"""Hand-offs between a parent and the sub-agent it asked for, kept across a crash.

A sub-agent request crosses three hand-offs, and each one writes what it is
about to do before doing it, so the next Worker can finish it:

  * admission → inbox: an ``agent(to=…)`` Job for a busy target carries its
    inbox entry (``Job.deferred_inbox``) from admission on; the enqueue is
    idempotent by Job id, so recovery recreates a lost entry exactly once.
  * admission → dispatch: a spawn whose attach card is written after
    admission stays held until the card exists. The Job records which
    process submitted it (``Job.submitter``); once that process is gone,
    recovery writes the card if it is missing and publishes the Job.
  * terminal → parent: the terminal write marks the Job ``notice_pending``
    with the writing process; queuing the notice settles it. A mark whose
    writer is gone is replayed. A waited-on Job whose waiter died is told
    to its parent the way a background one is.
