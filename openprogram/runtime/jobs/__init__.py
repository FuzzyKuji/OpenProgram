"""Async job lifecycle — explicit Job entity, worker pool, cancel.

See ``docs/design/runtime/async-job-lifecycle.md`` for the full design.

Public surface:

  * :class:`Job` / :class:`JobStatus` — entity + state machine
  * :func:`get_runner` — process-wide singleton JobRunner
  * :class:`JobRunner` — thread-pool executor with cancel + persistence

Status transitions (one-way):

  pending → queued → running → completed
                            ↘ cancelled
                            ↘ errored

The runner submits work to a ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` and keeps a
parallel ``threading.Event`` per job for cancel signalling. Each
state transition writes a row to ``<session>/jobs.json`` and rides
the session git commit machinery (commit message: ``job: <id>
<status>``).
