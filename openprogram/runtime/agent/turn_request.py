"""The request one persistent turn runs under, and the request in force now.

``TurnRequest`` carries what a turn needs and what may not be downgraded
below it: the session and Agent, the source, the permission mode and rules,
and the speaker's authority. The conversation engine builds one per turn and
binds it with :func:`set_turn_request`; the call core reads it back, binds a
standalone one around a plain library call (``runtime_scope``) and derives
the request an inner ``AgentSession``'s tools are gated by
(:func:`inner_turn_request`). Nothing bound means no turn is running.

The types depend only on the standard library, so every layer can import
them; ``openprogram.runtime.conversation.turn_runtime`` re-exports them.
