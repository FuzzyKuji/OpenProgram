"""The link between the core and the interface that shows live sessions.

Core code tells the open clients that something changed — a goal, a todo
list, a title, a branch, a native window, a streamed execution frame, the
context ring — without knowing which interface shows them. It also reads the
interface's in-memory copy of an open session, moves HEAD through it, and
finds the documentation pages the interface ships. The Server
registers its implementation with :func:`register` when it loads; every core
call goes through the functions below.

With no interface registered (a CLI process, a test without the Server) the
notices go nowhere and :func:`live_session` reports no in-memory session,
which is what the Server does while no client is connected.

Frames sent here go straight to the clients. :func:`openprogram.runtime.events.emit_ws_frame`
is the bus route for producers that also want the frame in the event log;
these notices are high-volume or carry captures, so they skip the log.
