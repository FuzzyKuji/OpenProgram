/**
 * Chat turn submit + stop.
 *
 * `submit` first recognizes a whole-input registered function expression,
 * then a slash command (during a run and while a request waits too), then
 * a reply to a waiting request, a mid-run queue/steer decision, or a normal
 * turn. A normal turn
 * expands long-paste tokens and `@path` mentions, converts pending docs
 * into path mentions plus `type:"document"` attachments, and hands the
 * payload to `sendChatMessage` — the bridge that fires the optimistic user
 * bubble, welcome-hide and running flip before the WS write. With the
 * socket closed the message waits in the send queue instead and goes out
 * after the reconnect.
 *
 * `stop` sends `execution.cancel` for the current execution, patches the
 * live assistant to cancelled, and clears runningTask so the composer is
 * free at once. The send queue waits until the server releases the turn.
 * Server cancelled still wins on reload.
